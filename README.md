Open Currency
=============

Open Currency is a Drupal 7 module that provides a currency calculator in a block. It utilizes the Open Exchange Rates API (openexchangerates.org) to get real-time currency updates and the money.js library(http://josscrowcroft.github.io/money.js).

This was an experiemental project to explore the use of Angular.js and Drupal.

##Notes

- Angular.js requires jQuery version 1.7.1 and above. Drupal 7's default jQuery version is 1.4.4. If you would like to try this module out, I recommend the jQuery Update module (https://drupal.org/project/jquery_update).
- You will need an Open Exchange Rates API key, which you can obtain from here: https://openexchangerates.org/signup/free (a forever free plan is available).
